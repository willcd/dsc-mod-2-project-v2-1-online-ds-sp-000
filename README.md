## The Project

###  Business Problem

For this project, I'll attempt to build some linear-regression models to predict house prices in King County (Washington State, which contains Seattle).

My focus will be on providing modelling data that will help a fledgling regional real estate website, รก lรก Zillow.com, design an algorithm to help customers determine their home's value, without having had a professional appraisal, and help give them a ballpark figure as a starting point. This could also help them find out what their home might be worth if they adjusted certain values, which could inform possible renovations before deciding to sell.

Since most people are not real estate experts or appraisers, I'd like to focus on features that are either able to be easily given by the home owner, or can be calculated/estimated by the website.

At the end, I'll give my recommendations and insights based on my modelling results.

I'll attempt to answer these primary questions:

1. What features are the best predictors of home price?
2. What is the most understandable/useable model that can be built with those predictors?
3. What tools can be built using this model?
4. What additional functions could be developed to make this better or keep it relevant in the future?

## Contents

### 1. Notebook

This contains all the code for this project. I employ the OSEMN approach for conducting data science, which stands for Obtain / Scrub / Explore / Model / iNterpret. I use iterative modelling approaches to utilize the dataset to create a workable model for predicting house prices.

At the end, I present recommendations and some more visualizations to demonstrate my findings and the strength of the model.

### 2. Presentation PDF - non-technical

These are the slides used for the non-technical presentation of my model, findings, and recommendations, as seen in the video linked above.

### Thank you!

I had a lot of fun working on this project, and feel that I have really strengthened my skills in working through a full data science workflow.
